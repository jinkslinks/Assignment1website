# My Profile
<p>Hi my name is Jai Iâ€™m from Melbourne, Australia and I live in a place called Mount Eliza. Some stuff you should know about me is that I love games, sports, movies, friends(girlfriend btw), dogs and anime, one fact about me that would be interesting is that I have more than a years played time World of Warcraft(very sad I know). I left high school after I finished Year 10 and went to do my Diploma of IT which I completed in 2018. 
  My student number is S3762742 
  My email address is s3762742@student.rmit.edu.au 
  My personal email is jaifarmer99@gmail.com.</p>
<p> I have many interests in IT such as Games, Robots, AI, Transportation, SpaceX, Hacking(Ethical) and VR. Anything to do with games I am generally interested in, the first time I was interested in IT, was when my dad bought a family computer and bought a copy of WoW which was a huge game back in the day, I remember having to install it with at least 5 disks(took a whole day to download). World of Warcraft was pretty much my childhood can as all my cousins use to play and we would play it for the whole day. I have a lot of IT experience as I been using it all my life, I can understand most aspects of IT world as I am quite interested in the topic.</p>
<p>I chose RMIT because it looked the most promising out of all the Universities I saw online, as it has one of the most cool looking campuses in the world in my opinion. I also heard from friends they are one of the best universities and my Melbourne and they really loved studying here.</p>
<p>I expect to learn a more in-depth view of the IT world and, and the opportunities that it can give me such as a bountiful career. I hope to become an expert in Java and other programming languages such as python, C++ and C#, I also aspire to become a skilled cyber security person.</p>

<p>The job entails in specialising in penetration testing and creating high detailed reports on vulnerabilities a business might have and to create solutions for the cyber security problems. This job appeals to me because it includes the things I want to learn such as Java, Python and using penetration systems to test the security of websites and applications, It also has very high salary.
The Skills I would need for this job is a high level of JavaScript, Objective C and Python, this role needs a high level of problem solving skill, as you will be trying to penetrate systems as well as creating and improving them. The Qualifications I would need for this job would be to have at least an industry certification in one of the following: SANS, CREST CRT/CCT or OSCE and to know the vulnerabilities regarding to OWASP and SANS.  I would need experience in performing internal and external penetration testing, web application testing and mobile penetration testing.
 </p>
 <p>The skills I currently have is beginner knowledge in Python and JavaScript as well as having good knowledge on how computers work, and can use most software for work purposes. I currently know nothing about cyber security and I am very interested in trying to learn it and understand how it all works. I currently have no experience in the IT field for a work point of view, however I have been using computers all my life and continue to use them on a daily basis.
I will need to improve my skills in JavaScript and Python greatly and start to understand how cyber security works but using one of my IT electives next year to study it in greater detail. I will then try to do an industry cyber security course(SANS) in order to learn the advanced methods of penetration testing and how it works in the job industry. I am also interested in doing a course in Ethical Hacking as I believe it would help greatly in the cyber security spectrum.
