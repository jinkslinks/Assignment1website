# My Profile
<p>Hi my name is Jai I’m from Melbourne, Australia and I live in a place called Mount Eliza. Some stuff you should know about me is that I love games, sports, movies, friends(girlfriend btw), dogs and anime, one fact about me that would be interesting is that I have more than a years played time World of Warcraft(very sad I know). I left high school after I finished Year 10 and went to do my Diploma of IT which I completed in 2018. 
  My student number is S3762742 
  My email address is s3762742@student.rmit.edu.au 
  My personal email is jaifarmer99@gmail.com.</p>
<p> I have many interests in IT such as Games, Robots, AI, Transportation, SpaceX, Hacking(Ethical) and VR. Anything to do with games I am generally interested in, the first time I was interested in IT, was when my dad bought a family computer and bought a copy of WoW which was a huge game back in the day, I remember having to install it with at least 5 disks(took a whole day to download). World of Warcraft was pretty much my childhood can as all my cousins use to play and we would play it for the whole day. I have a lot of IT experience as I been using it all my life, I can understand most aspects of IT world as I am quite interested in the topic.</p>
<p>I chose RMIT because it looked the most promising out of all the Universities I saw online, as it has one of the most cool looking campuses in the world in my opinion. I also heard from friends they are one of the best universities and my Melbourne and they really loved studying here.</p>
<p>I expect to learn a more in-depth view of the IT world and, and the opportunities that it can give me such as a bountiful career. I hope to become an expert in Java and other programming languages such as python, C++ and C#, I also aspire to become a skilled cyber security person.</p>

<p>The job entails in specialising in penetration testing and creating high detailed reports on vulnerabilities a business might have and to create solutions for the cyber security problems. This job appeals to me because it includes the things I want to learn such as Java, Python and using penetration systems to test the security of websites and applications, It also has very high salary.
The Skills I would need for this job is a high level of JavaScript, Objective C and Python, this role needs a high level of problem solving skill, as you will be trying to penetrate systems as well as creating and improving them. The Qualifications I would need for this job would be to have at least an industry certification in one of the following: SANS, CREST CRT/CCT or OSCE and to know the vulnerabilities regarding to OWASP and SANS.  I would need experience in performing internal and external penetration testing, web application testing and mobile penetration testing.
 </p>
 <p>The skills I currently have is beginner knowledge in Python and JavaScript as well as having good knowledge on how computers work, and can use most software for work purposes. I currently know nothing about cyber security and I am very interested in trying to learn it and understand how it all works. I currently have no experience in the IT field for a work point of view, however I have been using computers all my life and continue to use them on a daily basis.
I will need to improve my skills in JavaScript and Python greatly and start to understand how cyber security works but using one of my IT electives next year to study it in greater detail. I will then try to do an industry cyber security course(SANS) in order to learn the advanced methods of penetration testing and how it works in the job industry. I am also interested in doing a course in Ethical Hacking as I believe it would help greatly in the cyber security spectrum.

 <p>The result for the Myers-Briggs test was ENFJ-A, I used the https://www.16personalities.com/ website.</p>

 <p>The result for the online learning style test is, Jai's scores:</p>
<p>Auditory: 30%</p>
<p>Visual: 35%</p>
<p>Tactile: 35%</p>

<p> I chose to do a creativity course for my third test from testmycreativity.com and managed to get a creativity score of 60.65.</p>

<p>The results of these tests give me a good idea of how I should work within a team as it shows how I do well in some areas and also tells me were I have weaknesses. 
The results tells me that I am more of a leader than a follower as I like to take initiative and take order in what I’m doing. I also learn better visually rather than through auditory which explains a lot.
When forming a team I should now show better learning habits as in to create a better environment to work in, by creating helpful visuals that can everybody understand the topic better. </p>
<p>The project I will be creating will be an application that you can use on any device, however it will be mainly  focused on android and ios. The goal for this project is to create a functional cyber security app that tests the levels of security for various applications or websites. Its main appeal would be to have an application on your phone that scan all your data so to see if there any viruses or threats.
</p>
<p>The motivation comes from being interested in the cyber security aspect of IT, as it can be very interesting and cool at times. I have always been very interested in hacking as it is kind of mysterious and people don’t really know how it works.Allegedly at school, we always used software to bypass the security that the school had installed on their network to play games. This is when my motivation and interested started into the cyber security of computers. </p>
<p>The features that this product will include: The ability to identify possible flaws in applications, websites, passwords and even just from everyday life. This will to try solve the problems people can have online and just security issues in general. The main focus of this app will try to reduce threats and risks that you may face in your everyday life, it will start by offering simple advice of security about passwords and all the beginner stuff that comes with security. It will also try to warn you about problems that it can currently see on a website or an application your on, for example if you are on a website and there is a YouTube link it will see if it is a legit link e.g. if its www.youtub.com/aqfis827  it will flag it. It will also warn you of unnecessary software you have installed on your device, such as a game you have played in 2 years however it using 25 gigs of data. The features of this app can be endless, however its main focus will be based around security online and keeping its users safe.This application will try to appeal to most of the market as it can be used in every circumstance.
</p>
<p>The software I would have to create is an advanced scanning software that checks inconsistencies within code/websites and apps that could be potential threats. (discuss about software that compares to my project)
</p>
<p>The skills I would need to build the project would be, skills in Java and skills in cyber security. The skills in cyber security will take a long time to obtain however, learning Java should not take long. The software I would have to create would be very complicated as it would have to scan through applications or websites to check for potential threats using its own virus scanning software.
</p>
<p>If the project were to be successful i believe it would be an application that 			would be very popular if it could detect all the potential problems within your 		phone with one button. The original problem I had, was needing to download 		all these suspicious looking software to check my computer for any problems 		and generally usually did the opposite of solving the problem. The impact that 		this development will have is to provide a solution for easy and simple virus/			thereat checking for devices.
