<center><h1>My Profile</h1></center>
<h2> Personal Information </h2>
<p>My name is Jai Farmer and my number is S3762742</p>
<p>My RMIT email address is s3762742@student.rmit.edu.au</p> 
My personal email is jaifarmer99@gmail.com
<p> I live in the Mount Eliza green belt in Southeast Victoria.</p>
<p> I left school after finishing year 10 and then completed my Diploma of Information Technology. The Diploma gave me a great introduction to project management, coding in Javascript, HTML and website design. This gave me enthusiasm to apply to RMIT and pursue a Bachelor in IT. </p>
<p> My personal interest include computer games, basketball, fantasy and sci fi movies, spending time with my friends especially my girlfriend.</p>
<p>I have a special condition called heterochromia, which means one of my eyes has a different colour in it, I also have 20/20 hindsight.</p>

<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
<p> I have a wide interest in many IT areas such as game development, robotics, Articial intelligence, virtual reality, SpaceX, hacking(Ethical) and drones. I have a special interest in playing computer games such as World of Warcraft, Starcraft, Diablo, Counter Strike, Dota2 and Sid Meier's Civilization V.</p>
<p>the first time I was interested in IT, was when my dad bought a family computer and bought a copy of WoW which was a huge game back in the day. I remember having to install it with at least 5 disks(and it took a whole day to download the game). World of Warcraft was my favourite game as my cousins also played with me and completed the content together.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I chose RMIT because the IT course had a great reputation and a good campus. I also heard from my friends that RMIT is one of the best universities in Melbourne for IT.</p>
<p>I expect to learn a more in-depth view of the IT world and I hope that the opportunities that it can give me lead to a bountiful career. I hope to become an expert in Java and other programming languages such as python, C++ and C#. I also aspire to become a skilled cyber security person.</p>

<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
<p></p>
<a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/38493168?searchrequesttoken=eda8d8cb-e005-4e4e-8377-8c0fbbbd2c61&type=standout">Seek Website Link</a>
 <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/awj07Ri.png" alt="center" alt="Image" height="1000" width="600" /> </p>
<p>The job entails specialising in penetration testing and creating high detailed reports on vulnerabilities a business might have and to create solutions for the cyber security problems. This job appeals to me because it includes the things I want to learn such as Java, Python and using penetration systems to test the security of websites and applications, It also has very high salary.
The Skills I would need for this job is a high level of JavaScript, Objective C and Python, this role needs a high level of problem solving skill, as you will be trying to penetrate systems as well as creating and improving them. The Qualifications I would need for this job would be to have at least an industry certification in one of the following: SANS, CREST CRT/CCT or OSCE and to know the vulnerabilities regarding to OWASP and SANS.  I would need experience in performing internal and external penetration testing, web application testing and mobile penetration testing.
 </p>
 <p>The skills I currently have is beginner knowledge in Python and JavaScript as well as having good knowledge on how computers work, and can use most software for work purposes. I currently know nothing about cyber security and I am very interested in trying to learn it and understand how it all works. I currently have no experience in the IT field for a work point of view, however I have been using computers all my life and continue to use them on a daily basis.
I will need to improve my skills in JavaScript and Python greatly and start to understand how cyber security works but using one of my IT electives next year to study it in greater detail. I will then try to do an industry cyber security course(SANS) in order to learn the advanced methods of penetration testing and how it works in the job industry. I am also interested in doing a course in Ethical Hacking as I believe it would help greatly in the cyber security field.

<h2> Person Profile </h2>
 <p>The result for my Myers-Briggs test was ENFJ-A(Extraversion, Intuition, Feeling, Judgement). I believe this is reasonably accurate as I am certainly more extravoerted than introverted and enjoy spending time with my friends in person and keeping up with what is happening in their lives. Being more extravortedr can be a bit of a distraction though when you need to settle down and get work done as you are wodnering what else you could be doing with your friends. I do think I rely on intuition and my gut feeling to make decisions as I want to make sure something feels right before I decide to investigate further. So the test was interesting and worthwhile for anyone to get some ideas about how their mind works. </p>

<p>The result for the online learning style test is, Jai's scores:</p>
<p>Auditory: 30%</p>
<p>Visual: 35%</p>
<p>Tactile: 35%</p>

<p> I chose to do a creativity course for my third test from testmycreativity.com and managed to get a creativity score of 60.65.</p>

<p>The results of these tests give me a good idea of how I should work within a team as it shows how I do well in some areas and also tells me were I have weaknesses. 
The results tells me that I am more of a leader than a follower as I like to take initiative and take order in what I’m doing. I also learn better visually rather than through auditory which explains a lot.
When forming a team I should now show better learning habits as in to create a better environment to work in, by creating helpful visuals that can everybody understand the topic better.</p>

<h2> Project Idea </h2>
<p>The Project I am creating involves the <b>Evaluation and Repair of Cyber Security leaks and threats in software</b>. This application runs on any device, however my focus market will be Smart Phone platforms, e.g Android and iOS. The goal for this project is to create a functional cyber security application that tests the levels of security for various applications and/or websites. Its main appeal would be to have an application on your phone that scan for vulnerabilities and potential threats from hackers. The application is aimed at keeping our personal data safe from being misused. I believe many people would want to use the Application to get a sort of score out of 10 on how good their personal security is for a website or other software they are using. 
</p>
<p>The motivation comes from my personal interest in the cyber security aspect of IT as my Dad's company was hacked by a competitor and it cost him dearly as the attack was quite sofisticated over several months and all new business leads were diverted leading to a downturn in his business and he was forced to close down after 15 years and emplopying over one hundred people. Cyber Security is getting more sofisticated and there seems to be very little the Government and Police Force can actually do to track down cyber crime and protect people. It therefore falls on others to build the software required to keep ahead of the cyber crime curve.</p>

<p>I believe we all need to be more aware of the risks in using the Internet and so an application that evaluates your risks and gives a score on those risks would be very helpful and there will be a market for the product as long as it works seemlessly and makes it easy for any user to implement and plug of security vulnerabiltiies without hassle. The key is having remedies to counter the threats detected and make people's online browsing much more secure. </p>

<p>For around five years I have had a strong personal interest in ethical hacking and writing scripts that can help make my life easier online. The more I have invested in learning to master this area the more I realised that the Cyber Security arena is just massive and I have just scraped the tip of the iceberg. It is sort of exciting to know that you could never learn everything as every time someone builds a peicen of software people are finding vulnerabiltieis to exploit so the task of protecting systems will never go away. I think a career in cyber security will not dissapear any time soon that is for sure.</p>
 
<p>I believe that cyber security is a kind of mysterious area of the computer world and people don’t really know how it works. When I was at school, there were a lot of students who knew more than the IT department and certainly the IT teachers (usually the Maths teachers who didn't know much about computer programming at all and had no real world exposure to the IT industry in any form). This meant  that the school was vulnerable to a rogue IT expert stduent who could hack the systems and of course this eventually did happen at my school and happened several times to the embarrassment of the school. I was of course on the side of how we could stop such bad behaviour and this was an early reason why it seemed interesting to me to get into cyber security so we could stop cyber bullying and cyber attacks to protect people from bad behaviour of the few.</p>

<p><b>The features of my Cyber Security Detection Application include:</b> 
 <p>--->Be Simple to use with simple touch & click menu for mobile devices</p>
 <p>--->Be able to stress test the website and/or software in question to see if and how it can be hacked,</p>
 <p>--->Write a Report identifying those vulnerabilities in plain English,</p>
 <p>--->Highlighting any software or methods being used that are ptoentially dangerous,</p>
 <p>--->Provide a Security Threat Score - say - out of 10 points so simple to understand,</p>
 <p>--->Provide advice on what could be done to improve the security score</p>
 

<p>The first focus of this application will be aimed at how to reduce basic threats and risks that you may face in your everyday Internet Surfing life. We will be able to highlight security risks such as where oyu may be entering passwords and checking URLs to ensure they are actually legitiamate. People too easily just click on email and weblinks and do not carefully watch where they may be taken. My software could start out by at least watching over this and letting people know if they are going to an odd looking website that may be risky. E.g. it  will warn you about problems like clicking on a simple YouTube link that takes you somewhere potentially dangerous and flag this straight away.</p>

<p>The features of this app can be endless, however its main focus will be based around security online and keeping its users safe.This application will try to appeal to people in the market with minimal computer security expertise which is most people online. I thought about creating a Website with a short 1 minute Security Test and if you score below 5/10 it would recommend you invest more time into keeping yourself safe and take you to an introductory video on how the application works with lots of credible referees who give postive stories about hwo the Application is heloping them keep safe.</p>

<p>Some of the skills I will need to build for this project involve programming in a varierty ofcommon languages used on the Internet and in common software like Javascript, Java, C++ & HTML. The skills in cyber security will take a long time to obtain and I probably need to do further certification after my Bachelor course in specific cyber security areas. I would also like to work in a cyber security development firm for several years to gain experience and build some networks.</p>

<p>The software I would have to create would be very complicated as it would have to scan through applications or websites to check for potential threats using its own knowledgebase of what looks like a dodgy site as well as virus scanning software.</p>

<p>The original problem I encountered was needing to download software online and not being able to determine if the website is legitimate or not and whether I am just loading malicious software onto my computer. The impact that	this Application will have is to provide a solution for easy and simple virus/threat checking for mainly mobile devices that can be used on the fly to check the Apps already installed or about to be installed and any websites the user wishes to visit at the time they visit so as to stop cyber crime and hackers early enough to be helpful.</p>
